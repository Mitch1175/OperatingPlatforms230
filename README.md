# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted to develop a game called, "Draw It or Lost It", that allowed people to guess an random image against each other. The program was originally made for Android, but had the capability to expand to more platforms. The main software requirement was memory and how the images would be stored and accessed.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this project I was able to research and make comparisons about a decision to expand. I decided to expand to other mobile devices and recreate the program as "cross-platform". This way the team could use it to expand even further if the game takes off, by using similar code.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document was like a blueprint for the program. It was easy to refer to, but also kept everything in line by using the same terms.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my original UML diagram and add more details. The UML diagram is a good blueprint to refer back to, but if we added a secondary one, it would be easier to implement with multiple developers.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I followed the user's needs by planning out what they wanted and what was important. It is important to consider because you aren't getting paid to make a project for yourself, you are fulfilling someone else's ideas into an application.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the software with an open mind and a notebook to capture the important plans. In the future I think it is good to have a detailed blueprint that all developers can use and collaborate with.
